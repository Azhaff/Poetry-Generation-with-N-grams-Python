## Poetry Generation with N-grams

### Overview
This project explores natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate creative and expressive poetry. The goal is to construct three stanzas, each comprising four verses with 7 to 10 words per verse. The generated poem aims to exhibit technical proficiency while evoking emotions and imagery, inspired by the styles of renowned poets William Shakespeare and Maya Angelou.

### Features
- **Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram Models**: The project uses N-gram models to predict and generate words, ensuring the generated verses are coherent and stylistically similar to the chosen poet.
- **Random Verse Length**: Each verse has a length between 7 and 10 words, adding variability and natural flow to the generated poetry.
- **User Input for Poet Style**: The user can select between the styles of William Shakespeare and Maya Angelou, influencing the vocabulary and structure of the generated poem.

### How It Works

1. **Load and Tokenize Corpus**: The script reads text files containing the works of the chosen poets and tokenizes the text into words.
2. **Generate N-gram Models**: Using the tokenized words, unigram, bigram, and trigram models are generated using NLTK's `ConditionalFreqDist`.
3. **Generate Verses and Stanzas**: For each stanza, four verses are generated using the N-gram models. Each verse's length is randomly determined within the specified range.
4. **User Input and Poem Generation**: The user is prompted to choose a poet's style, and the script generates and prints three stanzas using the selected style.

### File Structure
- `shakespeare.txt`: Text file containing works by William Shakespeare.
- `angelou.txt`: Text file containing works by Maya Angelou.
- `poetry_generation.py`: Python script implementing the N-gram models and poetry generation logic.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poetry-generation-ngram.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd poetry-generation-ngram
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

### Usage
1. Ensure the text files `shakespeare.txt` and `angelou.txt` are in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python poetry_generation.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompt to select the poet style (Shakespeare/Angelou).

### Example Output
```plaintext
In which style do you want to generate the poem? (Shakespeare/Angelou): Shakespeare
Unigram Model Stanza:

Upon a time the heavens did sing
With spirits bright and lights agleam
In twilight's gentle, whispering wing
A dream awoke, in night serene


Bigram Model Stanza:

To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pauseâ€”there's the respect.


Trigram Model Stanza:

Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
```

### Challenges and Enhancements
- **Word Prediction**: Selecting subsequent words involves predicting the most probable next word based on the N-gram model.
- **Rhyming**: Future enhancements could include a rhyming dictionary to add artistic quality to the generated verses.
- **Comparison of Models**: The generated stanzas using unigram, bigram, and trigram models provide a comparison of their effectiveness in creating coherent poetry.
